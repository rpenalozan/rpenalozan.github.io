<p> I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="http://www.ir.disco.unimib.it/">
IKR3 Lab</a> of the <a href="https://en.unimib.it/">University of Milano-Bicocca</a>. </p>

<p> My main interests are in Knowledge Representation. I devise techniques
for solving non-standard reasoning problems, and extend knowledge 
representation formalisms (in particular Description Logics) to handle 
meta-knowledge. I like to explore new challenges, and have worked in
many different topics.</p>

<p> My latest interest is in the representation and use of uncertainty in knowledge </p>
